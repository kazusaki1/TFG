# Ionic app with a RESTful backend
The purpose of this repository is to provide sample code for  building an Ionic app with a RESTful backend and testing it locally during development. This aim is to show what a full solution for an app like that may look like. One of the things that this repo shows is, a solution to the CORS issue i.e. when running a RESTful backend locally and testing the app using ionic serve, you may run into the [CORS] issue.
To know how to get started with this repo, i.e. instructions on how to set it up or to know more about my motivations for creating this repo, have a read of my blog posts
